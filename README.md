# Optimization_Techniques
I have used different optimization algorithms and methods provided in the SciPy library to find the optimal values of reaction constants and the time when reactant [Cb] maximizes. Four optimization methods were implemented using the ‘scipy.optimize.minimize’ function are:
1. SLSQP (Sequential Least SQuares Programming)
2. Powell
3. Nelder Mead
4. L-BFGS-B (Limited Memory-BFG- Bounded Constraints)
